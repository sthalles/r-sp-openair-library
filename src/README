This directory represents the original directory created for me to run the code
in the files grid_weather.R and Pheno_Thalles.R. Please, notice that the directories
have to be properly populated. The [metfiles] directory for example, has to have
meteorological data files downloaded from the HySplit ftp repository.


It is recomended to have the following file structure in this directory

- src
	- year (dir)
	- output (dir)
	- metfiles (dir)
	- defoliation (dir)
	- grid_weather.R (text file)
	- Pheno_Thalles (text file)
	- READ (text file)
